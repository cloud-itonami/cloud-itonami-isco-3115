(ns meng.advisor
  "TestAdvisor — proposes a mechanical test, inspection, or hazard-logging
  operation (record test/measurement data, log inspection findings, flag mechanical
  safety hazards, schedule site visits) for a registered project. The advisor is
  swappable: `mock-advisor` (deterministic, default in dev/tests/CI) or
  `llm-advisor` (wraps a real `langchain.model/ChatModel`). Either way the advisor
  ONLY produces a PROPOSAL — it never writes to the store and has no notion of
  project provenance or mechanical-hazard risk; `meng.governor` is the independent
  system that decides whether the proposal may proceed, per the itonami actor pattern.

  A proposal is a map:
    {:op :draft-test-record|:log-inspection-data|:flag-mechanical-hazard|:schedule-site-visit
     :effect :propose        ; the advisor NEVER emits a raw store write
     :stake :low|:medium|:high
     :confidence 0.0-1.0
     :rationale str}
  LLM parse failures always yield `:confidence 0.0` (never fabricate
  confidence), which forces the governor to escalate/hold."
