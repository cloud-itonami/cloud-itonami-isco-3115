(ns meng.governor
  "MenGGovernor — the independent safety/traceability layer for
  the ISCO-08 3115 mechanical engineering technician field test and inspection
  actor. Wired as its own `:govern` node in `meng.actor`'s StateGraph,
  downstream of `:advise` — the Advisor has no notion of project provenance or
  mechanical-hazard risk, so this MUST be a separate system able to
  reject a proposal (itonami actor pattern, per ADR-2607011000 / CLAUDE.md
  Actors section).

  `check` is a pure function of (request, context, proposal, store) ->
  verdict; it never mutates the store. The StateGraph's `:decide` node
  routes on the verdict:
    :hard? true                → :hold  (irreversible, no write)
    :escalate? true            → :request-approval (interrupt-before)
    otherwise                  → :commit

  HARD invariants (:hard? true, ALWAYS :hold, never overridable):
    1. project provenance  — the request's project must be registered.
    2. no-actuation         — proposal :effect must be :propose.
  ESCALATION invariants (:escalate? true, ALWAYS human sign-off, per the
  README robotics-premise: mechanical hazards always require human sign-off):
    3. :op :flag-mechanical-hazard.
    4. low confidence (< `confidence-floor`)."
